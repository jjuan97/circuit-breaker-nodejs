# circuit-breaker-nodejs

The circuit breaker is a pattern that allows control when simultaneous failures occur in a service. For instance, imagine service A repeatedly attempting to communicate with service B, which is unavailable due to latency or failure. In such a scenario, the circuit breaker will cut off communication with service B. After a timeout period, some requests will be allowed to reach service B again. If service B responds correctly, normal operation will resume.
